## CRAFTY: Clustering and Scraping For Bitcoin Deanonymization

This project represents the final project of the Web Scarping Laboratory course, for the Computer Science Bachelor's degree (University Of Pisa).
The project aims to implement a set of analysis and deanonymization techniques
for the Bitcoin blockchain. A Bitcoin Dataset is provided that contains a selection
of transactions included in the blocks between the genesis block, mined on 03-01-2009,
17:15:05 and the block of height 214562, mined on 31-12-2012, 11:52:37.
